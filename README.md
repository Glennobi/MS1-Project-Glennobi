## CADi User Types and their User Stories:
*	The SME sector business users:
    *	As a small business owner, living in very uncertain and socially distant times, I want to leverage the internet, to continue to be able to service existing customers, and still grow my business to service a new online audience.
    *	I want an online shop window to display my services, the ability to transact online, and to avail of government support and funding to transition my business. I want a local company, that I trust and would understand my business, to develop this for me.
*	Charity or Community Project users:
    *	We would like to develop and launch a new corporate look, a fresh modern website and a mobile app to aid, assist and support our members. The app and website should:
        *	Reach out all our members & their families, allow members and their family members to connect together & share their experiences 
        *	Provide assistance, track activities and events
        *	Be intuitive and easy to use , be easy on the eye, fun to look at and interact with
        *	Have a clear iconography and catchy name
        *	Run on all platforms, conform to GDPR
    *	As a charity / community project, we cannot afford a large development company, and would like to find a local agile dependable company to develop and support our look, app and website, a company that we can meet easily, and understands our local needs, and can adapt to future change.
*	Contract recruiter, looking for contract project or programme managers:
    *	As a contract recruiter, I want to be able to quickly find the right project managers and get a very clear picture of who they are and what they can do. I want evidence that they can fill the roles I need to fill for my clients.
    *	I want to be able to find and contact a resource easily and quickly, as suitable roles arise.
*	Large corporate, looking for a contract project or programme manager:
        *	As a senior manager in a large corporate, I want to be able to clearly see potential project managers, amongst applications, their skills and experience, and suitability to the role, without having to trawl the internet and agencies.
        *	I want to be able to reference, remember and hire a flexible resource to meet my immediate need.
*	Governmental institution, looking for a project to be managed, delivered and closed:
    *	As a reviewer of tenders, I want to be able to clearly see a potential project manager, their skills and experience, have them stand out, without having to trawl the internet and agencies.
    *	I want to be able to get a picture, additional information and hire an appropriate resource.

    *	Be found:
        *	be found easily online, in any search for “technical project management and delivery services”, “design services” or “software development” in Ireland, the Irish midlands particularly.
    *	Increase repeat and referred business:

        *	Be a better LinkedIn than LinkedIn
        *	Create a good, simple mobile “e-business card” and e-shop window for a complex service set.
        *	Be e-message and potentially e-commerce ready in future.

*	Developer Objectives:
    *	My Project Goals for the CADi delivery
    *	My goals are to develop and produce a website for CADi and it’s potential clients, that is:
        *	Easily found - using best HTML practice, incorporating good HTML structure, structure tags, and content for best SEO.
        *	Clean and clear in appearance - by using Bootstrap for clean familiar appearance to the user, also using common Font Awesome iconography.
        *	Intuitive and pleasant to use – using nice consistent colours, good common and consistent page layouts, easy navigation and clear form structure for enquiries. 
        *	Original and memorable in look and feel – through the use of strong colours, and good logo, by over-riding Bootstrap styling with customised CSS where appropriate.
        *	Simple well-structured content clearly dividing CADi’s complex service set.
        *	Responsive and quick to use – with consistent navigation throughout the website.
    *	Scalable in future scope and function, ready for JavaScript.
## Scope
*	Functional spec
    *	The only functions available at this stage are to display CADi’s services and contact details, clearly and memorably to potential customers, across 4 pages. It is a static website at this stage.
    *	There will be an enquiry form that users may fill and perform a dummy submit.
    *	This feature will not become functional until later in the course, when JavaScript has been covered.
*	Content requirement
    *	Content must be clear and concise, cover all CADi services, explained simply to the end user.
    *	This is a business website not a personal resume, so no detailed CVs or Resumes are necessary.
## Structure
*	Interaction design
    *	There are 4 buttons on all 4 pages that will bring you around the website. The browser “back” or “refresh” button will not need to be used. This will keep users on our website, reducing the risk of clicking away.
    *	There is a form, that will allow population only at the MS1 stage.
*	Information design
    *	Information is grouped into a 1 home page with 2 pages on CADi’s key services, and a 4th easy to use enquiry form page.
    *	CADi’s services are defined in a 3 container set-up, on the 2 service pages, keeping with the “1/3 rule” for ease of viewing.
    *	Headings and Footers are common across all pages of the site, for consistency.
## Skeleton
*	Interface design
    *	The layout and presentation of this project is shown in the attached Mockplus generated wireframe files included in this development pack under files:
        *	MS1 Wireframe with Mockplus 1.pdf
        *	MS1 Wireframe with Mockplus 2.pdf
*	Navigation design
    *	Navigation must be well presented, and easy to find and use, and standard across the entire site. Font Awesome familiar iconography will be used.
    *	There will be an external link to LinkedIn
*	Information design
    *	Key information must be presented in 3 summary tables, keeping good development practice, and must be clear and concise.
    *	The whole site and it’s information will be responsive to the multitude of devices that it will be displayed on. The project will be developed using “Mobile First” methodology.
## Surface
*	Visual Design
    *	The colours used must match the existing logo and theme of CADi, comprising of gentle oranges, contrasting on greys and whites.
    *	The logo must be prominent. 
    *	The typography must be original but memorable, modern and plain.
    *	Imagery used must be used, that reflects former projects
    *	The Bootstrap CSS frame work will be used, with custom CSS styling where needed for local colours and logo. 
# Features
## Existing Features
*	Feature 1, Navigation - allows users to navigate easily between each of the four pages, using buttons, common on each of the four pages of the website, without needing to use the browser refresh or “back” buttons. It’s browser independent, once you stay on the site.
*	Feature 2, External Links – 1 to the CADi owner’s LinkedIn profile. This will be opened on a separate page, to ensure our user and their browser will “stick” with our site until they close it.
*	Feature 3, Enquiry form – The 4th page will be a full user enquiry form, with toggle buttons to select the appropriate services a user wants to enquire on. The form will take input, but will not be active at this stage of the course (MS1).
## Features Left to Implement
*	Enable Feature 3 – Enable the Enquiry form, to generate real user enquiries to be submitted via email.
*	Develop fully active features - and enable 3 more dynamic functions on a new page - develop blog, news and map location sections.
*	Tie in to accounting and payment systems like Stripe or PayPal.
