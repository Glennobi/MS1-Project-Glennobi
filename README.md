*   Feature 2, Find Us, a Google Map link on home page
    *   as a small business, charity or community user, I can open CADI's location in Google Maps, and see CADi hq in a seperate tab. This is very reassuring that I CADi has a physical local presence.
*   Feature 3, Generate an email
    *   as a user, this link allows me to instantly create and open an email to CADi, for direct contact and a detailed non-standard enquiry.

*	Developer Objectives:
    *	My Project Goals for the CADi delivery
    *	My goals are to develop and produce a website for CADi and it’s potential clients, that is:
        *	Easily found - using best HTML practice, incorporating good HTML structure, structure tags, and content for best SEO.
        *	Clean and clear in appearance - by using Bootstrap for clean familiar appearance to the user, also using common recognised Font Awesome iconography.
        *	Intuitive and pleasant to use – using nice consistent colours, good common and consistent page layouts, easy navigation and clear form structure for enquiries. 
        *	Original and memorable in look and feel – through the use of strong colours, and good logo, by over-riding Bootstrap styling with customised CSS where appropriate.
        *	Simple well-structured content clearly and simply showing CADi’s complex service set.
        *	Responsive and quick to use – with consistent navigation throughout the website.
    * By:
        *   having External Links that open in new tabs - keep the CADi website open.
        *   Being nice to use internal links that keep users away from the browsers refresh or back buttons.
        *   Being responsive from the smallest to the largest screens and devices
        *   being scalable in future scope and function, ready for JavaScript.

## Scope
*	Functional spec
    *	The functions available at this stage are to:
        *   give CADi a web online presence 
        *   display CADi’s overall services
        *   give the details behind 2 specific service sets, Web & App development and Project Management
        *   show CADi's contact details
        *   show CADi's location
        *   give easy live access through links to social media
        *   allow direct contact to CADi via email. 
    *   There is an enquiry form that users may fill and perform a dummy submit.
    *	This feature will not become functional until later in the course, when JavaScript has been covered.
*	Content requirement
    *	Content must be clear and concise, cover all CADi services, explained simply to the end user.
    *	This is a business website not a personal resume, so no detailed CVs or Resumes are necessary.

## Structure
*	Interaction design
    *	There are 4 buttons on all 4 page headings that will bring you around the website. The browser “back” or “refresh” button will not need to be used. This will keep users on our website, reducing the risk of clicking away.
    *	The "logo" also acts as a "home" button.
    *   There is a live email link allowing the user to email CADi diirectly
    *   There are two live social media links, that will open in new browser pages.
    *   In each of the detailed service pages there are 6 live links to other relevant sites, illustrating other work and past experience.
    *   There is a form, that will allow population only at the MS1 stage.
    *   There is one Google Maps link on the site for location of CADi
*	Information design
    *	Information is grouped into a 1 summary home page with 2 detailed pages on CADi’s key services, and a 4th easy to use enquiry form page.
    *	CADi’s services are defined in a HTML responsive table, on the 2 service pages, keeping with the “1/3 rule” for ease of viewing.
    *	Headings and Footers are common across all pages of the site, for consistency.

## Skeleton
*	Interface design
    *	The layout and presentation of this project is shown in the included Mockplus generated wireframes files, in the "wireframes" folder included in this development pack under files:
        *	MS1 Wireframe with Mockplus 1.pdf
        *	MS1 Wireframe with Mockplus 2.pdf
*	Navigation design
    *	Internal Navigation is clear, simple and well presented, easy to find and use, and standard across the entire site. Font Awesome familiar iconography is used.
    *	External Navigation uses Bootstrap gentle fading and re-colouring. There are external links to:
        *   LinkedIn

# Testing

## User Story Testing

### Heading and Footer Testing
*   I developed the common header and footer sections, common across the 4 pages of website.
*   I tested the navigation elements between all 4 pages.
*   I tested all the navigation containers, their functionality and appearance.
*   I tested and tuned the layout and responsiveness with basic placeholder text.
*   When happy with layout, response and responsiveness, I applied the content, and tested it again for layout then responsiveness.
*   I applied and tested various colour combinations then my logo.
*   I experimented and tested various bootstrap and Font Awesome iconography
*   I appled the icongraphy, motions and reactions to the active header elements and tested functionality, appearence and responsiveness.
*   I applied same to the active footer elements (email and social links) and tested function and responsiveness.
*   When happy with the hearings, footers, navigation and active elements, I set about styling the 4 detailed pages.

### Section and Content Testing
*   I had wireframed the content layout, and wrote the content outside Git
*   I selected applied and tested the background section imagery for the 4 .
*   Page 1 (of 4) - content was straightforward enough, spent time testing various font colours, weights and background opacity.
    *   It tested well for content, and worked well and responsively with the background image.
*   Page 2 & 3 - I decided to use and populate tables for the detailed (Who, What & How).
*   Pages 2, 3 & 4 - I used Bootstrap and tailored CSS to ensure tables and forms were responsive
    *   While the tables and forms looked great on medium and large devices, it was challenging getting them to display responsively on the smallest devices, especially the Samsung Fold and iPhone 5.
    *   I recorderd the screesizes of all the most common devices
    *   I wrote a test CSS file to tweak and tune all responsive CSS, and applied and tested rulesa across 10 device types and in protrait and landscape until I got all tables and forms to work well across all screen sizes and layouts.
    *   Key development then testing lesson - START WITH THE SMALLEST DEVICES, and work up!
    *   Key testing lesson - use style_copy.css CSS file so you can REVERT back if you make a mess of the nearly working original!      

### External nav links across the project:
*	Tested that all links change aspect and colour to ORANGE when hovered over then selected.
*	I clicked all links to ensure they worked, and enure they opened in a New Tab

### Internal nav links:
*	Tested that all links change aspect and colour to a darker GREY when hovered over then selected.
*	I clicked all links to ensure they worked, and enure they opened the correct page. The logo also act as a navigation to the home page.

### Enquiry Form:
*	Went to the "Enquiry" page
*	Filled the empty form and verified that an error message about the required fields appears
*	I tried to submit the form with an invalid email address and verified that a relevant error message appears
*	I submitted the form with all inputs valid and verified that a "Code Institute" success message appears.
*   I tested and verified that the form "Reset" button does just that.

## Code Validation Testing
* I ran my 4 HTML files through the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
    * I have NO ERRORS on my index.html file, [index.html - green banner](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fglennobi.github.io%2FMS1-Project-Glennobi%2Findex.html)

* I ran my CSS file thtough the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
    * I have NO ERRORS on my style.css file, [style.css - green banner](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fglennobi.github.io%2FMS1-Project-Glennobi%2Fassets%2Fcss%2Fstyle.css&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)
 
## Website Performance Testing
* I ran my 4 HTML files through the [Google PageSpeed to get Lighthouse scores](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)
    * [index.html score 99% desktop 88% mobile](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fglennobi.github.io%2FMS1-Project-Glennobi%2Findex.html&tab=desktop)
    * [webapp.html score 99% desktop 87% mobile](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fglennobi.github.io%2FMS1-Project-Glennobi%2Fwebapp.html&tab=desktop)
    * [project.html score 99% desktop 88% mobile](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fglennobi.github.io%2FMS1-Project-Glennobi%2Fproject.html&tab=desktop)

## Browser Compatibility Testing
*   I developed the project in Google Chrome and tested it there, on Firefox, Internet Explorer and on Microsoft Edge.
*   It looked and worked well on all 4 browsers, noting the following:
    *   Firefox was by far the best in terms of speed and responsiveness. On Page 4 of my website, my Enquiry Form, the tick boxes turn my grey colour, when selected on my form, as I wanted it.
    *   On Microsoft Edge, again, on Page 4 of my website, my Enquiry Form, the tick boxes turn my grey colour, when selected on my form, as I wanted it.
    *   On Google Chrome, they turn Bootstrap blue, and I could not over-ride this with loads of custom CSS!
    *   On Internet Explorer, I lost all opaque grey backgrounds on my Sections on all pages, texts, tables and forms. On speaking to a colleague, this is not unusual, in fact most development companies do not support Internet Explorer anymore.  
    
## Responsiveness Testing 
*   I tested responsivness in both portrait and landscape modes on:
    *   Moto G4, Galaxy S5, Pixel 2, Pixel 2XL, iPhone 5, 6, 7, 8, X, iPad, iPad Pro, Surface Duo, Galaxy Fold, Galaxy Note III
    *   See "bugs" section below.

## Bugs.
*   Un-ordered lists within tables are extremely difficult to display and make responsive on small and medium devices.
*   After loads of attempts, I scrapped the Unordered Lists and replaced them with new responsive table rows instead.
*   A good help to develop and test responsitivity is to draw a table of all common devices, and record their screen size width and height, in portrait and landscape, IN SIZE ORDER.
*   It is easier to start small and design up, than the other way around.
*   Inserting background images can change specificity and ruin a good layout! I had some playing around with various CSS "background" properties to gat it working.
*   Researched and found @media solutions to override CSS rules. Found "!important" keyword extremely helpful, in re-enforcing design and layout changes!
*   I found the only way to develop and avoid a lot of bugs:
    *   develop the project in stages from your wireframe
    *   using tight semantic HTML, developing all the common areas of all the pages of the site, Header and Footer first
    *   style these areas for the smallest devices up
    *   then design & develop the individual and unique Sections last
    *   style these Sections for the smallest devices upwards(this was the most time-consuming part of the project, 90% of the time getting the last 10% right!)

## Other Problems.
*   I had a lot of problems with GitHub, GitPod and Github Pages.
*   Whilst the "cheat-sheet" helped, I believe all course material needs to be updated in relation to repositories, workspaces and deployment (from Cloud9 etc).
