    *	Be found:
        *	be found easily online, in any search for “project management and delivery services”, “design services” or “software development” in Ireland, the Irish midlands particularly.
    *	Increase repeat and referred business:
        *	Create and socialise the CADi brand with a robust and memorable online presence
        *	Create a good, simple mobile “e-business card” and e-shop window for a complex service set.
        *	Be e-message and potentially e-commerce ready in future.

*	Developer Objectives:
    *	My Project Goals for the CADi delivery
    *	My goals are to develop and produce a website for CADi and it’s potential clients, that is:
        *	Easily found - using best HTML practice, incorporating good HTML structure, structure tags, and content for best SEO.
        *	Clean and clear in appearance - by using Bootstrap for clean familiar appearance to the user, also using common recognised Font Awesome iconography.
        *	Intuitive and pleasant to use – using nice consistent colours, good common and consistent page layouts, easy navigation and clear form structure for enquiries. 
        *	Original and memorable in look and feel – through the use of strong colours, and good logo, by over-riding Bootstrap styling with customised CSS where appropriate.
        *	Simple well-structured content clearly and simply showing CADi’s complex service set.
        *	Responsive and quick to use – with consistent navigation throughout the website.
    * By:
        *   having External Links that open in new tabs - keep the CADi website open.
        *   Being nice to use internal links that keep users away from the browsers refresh or back buttons.
        *   Being responsive from the smallest to the largest screens and devices
        *   being scalable in future scope and function, ready for JavaScript.

## Scope
*	Functional spec
    *	The functions available at this stage are to:
        *   give CADi a web online presence 
        *   display CADi’s overall services
        *   give the details behind 2 specific service sets, Web & App development and Project Management
        *   show CADi's contact details
        *   give easy live access through links to social media
        *   allow direct contact to CADi via email. 
    *   There is an enquiry form that users may fill and perform a dummy submit.
    *	This feature will not become functional until later in the course, when JavaScript has been covered.
*	Content requirement
    *	Content must be clear and concise, cover all CADi services, explained simply to the end user.
    *	This is a business website not a personal resume, so no detailed CVs or Resumes are necessary.

## Structure
*	Interaction design
    *	There are 4 buttons on all 4 page headings that will bring you around the website. The browser “back” or “refresh” button will not need to be used. This will keep users on our website, reducing the risk of clicking away.
    *	The "logo" also acts as a "home" button.
    *   There is a live email link allowing the user to email CADi diirectly
    *   There are two live social media links, that will open in new browser pages.
    *   In each of the detailed service pages there are 6 live links to other relevant sites, illustrating other work and past experience.
    *   There is a form, that will allow population only at the MS1 stage.
    *   There is one Google Maps link on the site for location of CADi
*	Information design
    *	Information is grouped into a 1 summary home page with 2 detailed pages on CADi’s key services, and a 4th easy to use enquiry form page.
    *	CADi’s services are defined in a HTML responsive table, on the 2 service pages, keeping with the “1/3 rule” for ease of viewing.
    *	Headings and Footers are common across all pages of the site, for consistency.

## Skeleton
*	Interface design
    *	The layout and presentation of this project is shown in the included Mockplus generated wireframes files, in the "wireframes" folder included in this development pack under files:
        *	MS1 Wireframe with Mockplus 1.pdf
        *	MS1 Wireframe with Mockplus 2.pdf
*	Navigation design
    *	Internal Navigation is clear, simple and well presented, easy to find and use, and standard across the entire site. Font Awesome familiar iconography is used.
    *	External Navigation uses Bootstrap gentle fading and re-colouring. There are external links to:
        *   LinkedIn
        *   Skype
        *   Email button
        *   A sample website completed by CADi
        *   A smaple Android app completed by CADi
        *   A sample Apple app completed by CADi
        *   A second link to LinkedIn
        *   A link to IBM Ireland's homepage, CADi qualifications and experience
        *   A link to the British Computer Society hompage, CADi qualifications
        *   A live form, submit and refresh button, to easily generate an enquiry to CADi 
*	Information design
    *	Key information is presented in 3 summary tables, keeping good development practice, and are clear and concise.
    *	The whole site and it’s information will be responsive to the multitude of devices and browsers, that it will be displayed on. The project will be developed using “Mobile First” methodology.

## Surface
*	Visual Design
    *	The colours used match the existing logo and theme of CADi, comprising of gentle oranges, contrasting on greys and whites.
    *	The typography must be original but memorable, modern and plain.
    *	Imagery used reflects former project
    *	The Bootstrap CSS frame work will be used, with custom CSS styling where needed for local colours and logo, or challenging responsiveness issues. 

# Features

## Existing Features
*	Feature 1, Navigation - allows users to navigate easily between each of the four pages, using buttons, common on each of the four pages of the website, without needing to use the browser refresh or “back” buttons. It’s browser independent, once you stay on the site.
*	Feature 2, External Links – 1 to the CADi owner’s LinkedIn profile, one to Skype. These will be opened on a separate page, to ensure our user and their browser will “stick” with our site until they close it.
*   Feature 3, A link to create and ope an email to CADi by the user
*   Feature 4, External links to CADi past work, experiences, qualifications
*	Feature 5, Enquiry form – The 4th page will be a full user enquiry form, with toggle buttons to select the appropriate services a user wants to enquire on. The form will take input, but will not be active at this stage of the course (MS1).
*   Feature 6, ONE subtle "Find Us" link to open location in Google Maps in seperate tab.

## Features Left to Implement
*	Enable Feature 5 – Enable the Enquiry form, to generate real user enquiries to be easily and quickly submitted.
*	Develop fully active features - and enable 3 more dynamic functions on a new page - develop blog, news and map location sections.
*	Tie in to accounting and payment systems like Stripe or PayPal.

# Testing
*  4 page layout - Heading and Footer - Development and Testing
    *   I developed the common header and footer sections, common across the 4 pages of website.
    *   I developed the navigation elements and tested between all 4 pages.
    *   I developed all the containers, their layout and basic content.
    *   I tested and tuned the layout and responsiveness with basic placeholder text.
    *   When happy with layout and responsiveness, I applied the content, and tested it again for layout then responsiveness.
    *   I applied and tested various colour combinations then my logo.
    *   I experimented and tested various bootstrap and Fon Awesome iconography
    *   I appled the icongraphy, motions and reactions to the active header elements and tested functionality, appearence and responsiveness.
    *   I applied same to the active footer elements (email and social links) and tested function and responsiveness.
    *   When happy with the hearings, footers, navigation and active elements, I set about styling the 4 detailed pages.
*   Section - Content Development & Testing
    *   I had wireframed the content layout, and wrote the content outside Git
    *   I selected applied and tested the background section imagery for the 4 .
    *   Page 1 (of 4) - content was straightforward enough, spent time testing various font colours, weights and background opacity.
        *   It tested well for content, and worked well and responsively with the background image.
    *   Page 2 & 3 - I decided to use and populate tables for the detailed (Who, What & How).
    *   Pages 2, 3 & 4 - I used Bootstrap and tailored CSS to ensure tables and forms were responsive
        *   While the tables and forms looked great on medium and large devices, it was challenging getting them to display responsively on the smallest devices, especially the Samsung Fold and iPhone 5.
        *   I recorderd the screesizes of all the most common devices
        *   I wrote a test CSS file to tweak and tune all responsive CSS, and applied and tested rulesa across 10 device types and in protrait and landscape until I got all tables and forms to work well across all screen sizes and layouts.
        *   Key development then testing lesson - START WITH THE SMALLEST DEVICES, and work up!
        *   Key testing lesson - use style_copy.css CSS file so you can REVERT back if you make a mess of the nearly working original!      
* Code Validation
    * I ran my HTML code through the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FGlennobi%2FMS1-Project-Glennobi)
        * On the first run, I had 45 errors and 51 warnings, none of which I understand at time of writing!
    * I ran my CSS code through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FGlennobi%2FMS1-Project-Glennobi.git&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#errors) 
        * On the first run, I had 106 errors and 7250 (!) warnings, I will need help here!

## TESTING SCENARIOS:
*	External nav links across the project:
    *	Tested that all links change aspect and colour to ORANGE when hovered over then selected.
    *	I clicked all links to ensure they worked, and enure they opened in a New Tab
*	Internal nav links:
    *	Tested that all links change aspect and colour to a darker GREY when hovered over then selected.
    *	I clicked all links to ensure they worked, and enure they opened the correct page. The logo also act as a navigation to the home page.
*  	Enquiry Form:
    *	Went to the "Enquiry" page
    *	Filled the empty form and verified that an error message about the required fields appears
    *	I tried to submit the form with an invalid email address and verified that a relevant error message appears
    *	I submitted the form with all inputs valid and verified that a "Code Institute" success message appears.
    *   I tested and verified that the form "Reset" button does just that.
*	I developed the project in Google Chrome and tested it there, on Firefox. Internet Explorer and on Microsoft Edge
    *   It looked and worked well on all EXCEPT for the following:
            *   Firefox was by far the best in terms of speed. On Page 4 of my website, my Enquiry Form, the tick boxes turn my grey colour, when selected on my form, as I wanted it.
            *   On Microsoft Edge, again, on Page 4 of my website, my Enquiry Form, the tick boxes turn my grey colour, when selected on my form, as I wanted it.
            *   On Google Chrome, they turn Bootstrap blue, and I can't change it!
            *   On Internet Explorer, I lost all opaque grey backgrounds on my Sections, on all pages, texts, tables and forms.  
    *	I tested responsivness in both portrait and landscape modes on:
        *	Moto G4, Galaxy S5, Pixel 2, Pixel 2XL, iPhone 5, 6, 7, 8, X, iPad, iPad Pro, Surface Duo, Galaxy Fold, Galaxy Note III
        *   See "bugs" section below.
*	List of bugs or problems discovered.
    *   Un-ordered lists within tables are extremely difficult to display and make responsive on small and medium devices.
    *   After loads of attempts, I scrapped the Unordered Lists and replaced them with new responsive table rows.
    *   A good help to develop and test responsitivity is to draw a table of all common devices, and record their screen size width and height in portrait and landscape, IN SIZE ORDER.
    *   It is easier to start small and design up, than the other way around.
    *   Inserting background images can change specificity and ruin a good layout!
    *   Researched and found @media solutions to override CSS rules. Found "!important" keyword extremely helpful, in re-enforcing design and layout changes!
