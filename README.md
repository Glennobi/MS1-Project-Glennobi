# Testing
Convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. 
Go over all user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
Test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
1.	Contact form:
i.	Go to the "Contact Us" page
ii.	Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
iii.	Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
iv.	Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
Mention how project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
Mention any bugs or problems discovered during testing, even if not addressed yet.

# Deployment
Describe the process to deploy the project to a hosting platform (i.e. GitHub Pages).
Describe how to run your code locally.
